Pawnder is a parody project created for fun and demonstration purposes.  
It is **not** an actual dating service for cats (…yet 🐱).  
No real cats are harmed, matched, or engaged in romantic relationships through this application.  

All names, images, and characters used are for comedic or illustrative purposes only.  
Any resemblance to actual feline dating platforms (if such a thing exists) is purely coincidental.

All “cat-style” speech, puns, and meow-based expressions are fictional and created solely for this project.  
They do not represent any real cat’s personal opinions, preferences, or dating history.
